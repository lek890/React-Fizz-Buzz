Fizz Buzz
-----------

A simple FIZZ BUZZ app using react js.

App component renders Form and FizzBuzzResult components.

FizzBuzzResult is the result of passing data and DisplayResult component to a HOC called setData.

DisplayResult component uses render prop to render the lists. Any new type of component can be passed to render the results by this way.

Unit tests are included.

I have tried implementing it in TypeScript as well. It is only partially completed.
